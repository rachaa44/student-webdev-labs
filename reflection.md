## Reflection Document

### HTML

The HTML section of the lab notebook was somewhat simple to complete, however I did require the videos to understand what was needed for the assignment, as it is difficult to understand from a screenshot alone what is needed or what is being shown. I did not need them for the first two exercises, however, I did for the remaining two. I found the Images exercise to be particularly helpful, but found that it was still quite time consuming to complete the table exercise, where the videos became particularly helpful.

### Accessibility

The Accessibility section contained only one exercise, the form accessibility update. After having completed the form exercise in the HTML section, this was somewhat simple to complete, though the video was necessary to understand what was needed without a markdown file or pdf with instructions. However, once the video explained what was needed, it was very quick to complete. A markdown file with instructions for the exercise would have been helpful, especially if it had more advice about accessibility that becomes relevant in future sections or in general. The materials posted on Canvas were very helpful in this, but having another file specifically in labs repo would be nice as well.

### CSS

The CSS section was extremely helpful in learning CSS specific formatting and organization. In this section, the video lectures and instructions were particularly helpful, as it is not always obvious from a screenshot what is being shown. Additionally, there are a lot of very specific formatting rules, which may have taken much additional time to sort through on my own without the help of the video tutorial. In this section, the Media Queries and Position sections were particularly helpful, as the extra instruction was needed for me to understand how to properly place the items on the screen. For me, the Specificity section was confusing, not that I needed to find the specificity of each grouping, but where to actually list my answers and how. (I am still unsure if I listed my answers in the expected fashion.) An example with how the answers should be formatted would have been helpful, but once I reviewed the video, I was able to add my notes to the css file. Something more interactive on this section would have been helpful, I am still unsure about some of the rules for specificity despite having a general understanding of how it works.

### Flexbox

This section contained only one exercise, though it was very involved. For this exercise, I actually had referenced the section videos and files prior to completing the section, for the purposes of the homework assignment. So, when completing the lab notebook exercise, I was already fairly familiar with Flexbox, though still needed some assistance from the videos for the layouts past the second flex-container. The videos explained how to complete these very thouroughly, though some of my layouts did not look exactly the same as the screenshots - which the video implied it was not necessary to look 100% exactly the same, as long as the layout was matching. I am hoping that this is the case, as attempting the get my pages to look exactly like the screenshots has been somewhat difficult without guidelines about what spacings to pay attention to in specific assignments.

### CSS Grid

The CSS Grid section was extremely helpful. In particular, the Grid Areas exercise was very helpful for my understanding of CSS Grid, and how to format grid pages for responsive viewport sizing and media queries. This was probably the most helpful section so far, and the video tutorials were super necessary for me to understand how it all works. There is so much to this section, and it is unfortunate there was not more time to spend on this topic. I believe that more exercises in this section would have been helpful, but I understand that taking more time on any section means less time on another.

### Bootstrap

The Bootstrap exercises were simple to complete, but quite complex in terms of the required formatting in the final exercise. The documentation is quite comprehensive, and so prior to working on the labs (or homework), that was extremely helpful for gaining an understanding of how to utilize the built in tools. The grid exercises were extremely helpful, and the modals exercise was both difficult and very helpful. I did require the videos to complete the latter exercises, but again, the Bootstrap documentation is quite comprehensive and made it easy to diagnose issues.

### Javascript

The Javascript exercises were quite a bit more involved than the previous sections, as getting used to a new language will present new challenges. The first few exercises were fairly simple to complete and, though I did watch and reference the videos, I did not need them to complete the exercises. However, exercises 4 - 7 were far more involved, and I was grateful for both the in class walk-throughs, as well as the video tutorials. Despite it being well explained in class and in the lecture videos, I am still struggling with some of the semantics and formatting for Javascript, though I expect that if I spend more time using the language, this won't be much of an issue.

### jQuery

The jQuery exercises were the most difficult for me, primarily because of the limited time we were able to spend with the topic and the great depth of functionality to wade through. However, using the video lecture and tutorial, I was able to complete exercise 2 with only a few issues, which I was able to resolve somewhat quickly. The Dom exercise was far more difficult for me, I don't know what I'm doing wrong! jQuery is wonderful for it's flexibility and effectiveness, however, it's quite complicated, and despite taking diligent notes in class and during the video lecture, I still had a difficult time working through the exercises without the video tutorials.
